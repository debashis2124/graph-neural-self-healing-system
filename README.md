# graph-neural-self-healing-system
A graph neural network (GNN)-based anomaly detection and self-healing framework for supply chain logistics. This system constructs dynamic similarity graphs using enriched order-level features, applies GCNs for threat classification, and implements a graph healing mechanism to autonomously remove or isolate compromised nodes.
