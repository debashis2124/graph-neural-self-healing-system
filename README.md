# Self-Healing Graph Neural Network for Supply Chain Anomaly Detection

This project implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based anomaly detection and self-healing system for supply chain logistics data. The framework constructs similarity graphs from order records, detects anomalous (compromised) nodes using several GNN models, and applies self-healing by removing these compromised nodes from the graph.

## üöÄ Features

- Dynamic similarity graph construction from logistics/order data
- SMOTE-based class imbalance handling
- Multiple GNN models: GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GIN
- Binary classification: Healthy vs. Compromised nodes
- Automated graph healing by node removal
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Specificity
- Training curves, confusion matrices, and healing visualizations
