Self-Healing GNN for Supply Chain
This project uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to find and fix (self-heal) problems in supply chain data. It uses order data to build graphs, detects "compromised" (anomalous) nodes, and removes them to improve the graph.

üöÄ What it Does
Makes graphs from logistics (order) data

Fixes class imbalance using SMOTE

Trains different GNN models (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GIN)

Finds compromised nodes (bad/at-risk orders)

Removes compromised nodes to heal the graph

Shows results: accuracy, F1 score, recall, precision, specificity

Draws plots for metrics and healing effect
